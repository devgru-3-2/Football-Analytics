## Introduction:
This repository contains a machine learning based prediction model that utilizes Poisson Distribution method to predict the outcome of FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. The model is trained on historical FIFA World Cup data and is capable of providing match predictions with a high degree of accuracy.

## Data:
The data used for training the model includes all the matches from 1930 to 2018 World Cup. The data includes various relevant attributes such as the teams playing, goals scored, date, stadium, and more. The data is pre-processed and cleaned to remove any inconsistencies and outliers.

## Methodology:
The model uses Poisson Distribution method to calculate the expected number of goals scored by each team in a match. The expected number of goals is then used to predict the outcome of the match (win, draw, or loss) based on the maximum expected number of goals.

## Requirements:
To run the model, you will need the following packages installed:

->Pandas

->Matplotlib

->Scikit-learn

## Conclusion:

This prediction model provides a reliable and accurate solution for predicting the outcome of the FIFA World Cup 2022. The model is a great tool for sports enthusiasts, analysts, and fans to get a better understanding of the World Cup matches and make informed decisions.
